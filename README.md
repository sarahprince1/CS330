How do I approach designing software?


What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Throughout this project, I was able to get an understanding on how to execute three-dimensional objects and make them mimic reality. Through the use of lighting, texture, and placement, I was able to bring my two dimensional image to life. I now know how to apply lighting and texture to an object. 

What design process did you follow for your project work?
Through a lot of trial and error, I was able to create my project. I would say I worked on each object in the scene individually to not overwhelm myself. Not only was each object individual, but so were any attributes (light, texture, size, etc).

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
While I do not see myself being involved with graphic design or animation, the coding practice was definitely beneficial. After all of the practice, I have a better understanding of syntax and proper placement of certain functions.

How do I approach developing programs?


What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
I would say my development strategy involved a lot of sketching things out. I had a notebook that I would sketch my original image, the objects I was including in my scene, and then write any attributes that I needed. For example, I had a red vase in my image. I sketched the vase and wrote the shapes I had to combine, the size, color, position and texture. Then, while I would begin to code, I had a list of things I needed to check off. This helped me execute everything efficiently. 

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was imperative to overcome this project successfully! Since there were multiple objects, textures, etc in my image, a lot of things had to be repeated. That being said, the more I started to do things, the quicker I got and started to understand better. While there were mesh functions for the shapes (so I did not need to fully repeat all shapes), the code for the texture I ended up using several times. I am glad this was the case because texture was the main thing I struggled with. Practice helped a ton. 

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
In the beginning, I was very flustered and nervous in how I was going to be able to execute such a demanding project. I had little knowledge with C++ and Microsoft Studio, so I was worried I would get stuck. And I did get stuck, many times. However, after reviewing all resources and a lot of trial and error, each milestone and its functions started to make sense. Everything built on each other so it was important to take the time necessary to learn each segment. 

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
I am still unsure which career path I want to follow within Computer Science. I believe I am aiming towards data analytics, perhaps in Marketing. I enjoy all of these different courses because they offer me experience with different coding languages and projects. It will be beneficial to me to have a broad understanding of as many coding languages as possible so I am prepared/comfortable to work for a company. 

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I only have a few courses left before I graduate but this knowledge will still help me in the future. I now can say I have worked with C++ and Microsoft Studio. Anytime in my academic future if C++ or animation software is being utlized, I can think back to this course or review my projects for aid. I will end up getting my masters degree eventually once I figure out what I want to do, and I am sure this curriculum will appear again!

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
As stated above, while I will not be going after a job that deals with animation or graphics, the coding experience alone will be great to have. I now understand different functions, syntax, and errors better; which is needed regardless of what computer science niche you fall into.
